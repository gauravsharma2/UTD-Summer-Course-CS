everything is stored in xml these days
and are pretty much stored somewhere in the cloud



RDM --> has XML syntax but also has semantics -
why is this better than XMl--> coz we can understand the semantics of it.. it can kinda represent knowledge within the documents


Merekel signature -is used to verify if the doc was tempered or not --> resulting doc after signature is called security enhanced doc  (SE-XML)


Hash (hash(auth) +hash(auth.title)) --> and go on doing this in a tree fashion.. toh bich mein kuch change hua toh we will know
hash value -> is calculated bottom up (from leave to the root of the tree)
